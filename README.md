# Stata-ResultsTbl
Runs analysis on table, takes list of scalars, creates output table, exports output table to Excel

This program runs in Stata.
A lot of identifying information about the project is removed.  (Information in the code is redacted to obscure the specific project.)
Hopefully the code may still be of use!


Stata code:
These tables take two datasets, 
Run an analysis, 
Saves the results in scalars,
Rearranges the scalars to have the information in an output table
Exports the output table into Excel.
